# Question 1 (50 points, 25 points per essay)

I have provided three essay prompts below. Select **two** of the three prompts - you will skip *either* a., b., or c. and answer them. We are looking for well-written, clear and thoughtful responses. Going a little over the suggested length is OK. Under is not OK.

- a. In the section on scientific blogging in Jeff Leek's *How to Be A Modern Scientist*, he remarks that "Everyone is an internet scientist now." In 5-10 complete English sentences, I want you to specify, using your own words and complete English sentences, one or two different ways in which you anticipate your work changing in light of this remark. What might you do differently, if you thought of yourself as an internet scientist? Do you, already, feel this way? Does this make being a scientist seem more or less appealing to you, and why? Please feel encouraged to provide an example from your own experiences that helps you explain your reactions to this idea.

- b. In 5-10 complete English sentences, I want you to specify, using your own words and complete English sentences, the least helpful piece of advice you took away from reading Jeff Leek's *How To Be A Modern Scientist*. Please provide a reference to the section of the book that provides this problematic advice. Please avoid selecting something because it does not apply to your current situation, but instead identify something that might be relevant to you, but that you are actually unwilling to do, and explain why. Please feel encouraged to provide an example from your own experiences that helps you explain why you are unwilling to take this piece of advice.

- c. Reread the section of Jeff Leek's *How To Be A Modern Scientist* on data sharing, where, among other things, he states that "the reproducibility debate is over." In 5-10 complete English sentences, I want you to specify how the "debate" over reproducibility has affected your field, and what changes you have made (or intend to make) in light of what you've learned in this course, from Leek's book, and from your experiences over the last year to make your work more reproducible. How important is building reproducible science in your field? In your view, what does "reproducible science" mean to you, and to the people you will be working with as you complete your degree program? Please feel encouraged to provide an example from your own experiences that helps you explain your reactions to the notion of reproducible science.
