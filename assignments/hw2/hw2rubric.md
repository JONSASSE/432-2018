# 432 Homework 2 Grading Rubric

The assignment was due at 1 PM on 2018-02-02.

## Question 1 (30 points)

- 20 points for fitting the correct model 
- 5 more points for Interpreting the ANOVA model to evaluate the effect of race on income
- 5 more points for the more appropriate conclusion (no meaningful difference in income across race groups, collapsed or not)
    - Subtract 2 points if they fail to collapse the small groups.

# Question 2 (20 points)

- 15 points for fitting the correct model with the collapsed variable created.
- 5 points for the correct conclusion (The conclusion would be that there aren't any statistically significant differences in `income` attributable to either `race_3` or `sex`.)

Note: If you fail to collapse the Race groups, then the Multi-Racial group will throw an error when you try to plot error bars, because a standard deviation (and thus a standard error) cannot be estimated.

# Question 3 (20 points)

- 15 points for fitting the correct model with the uncollapsed variable.
- 5 more points for the correct conclusion.

# Question 4 (30 points)

- 20 points for fitting a sensible model, using best subsets and cross valildation
- 5 more points for the correct conclusion and 5 more for accurately specifying the variables included in the final model.
