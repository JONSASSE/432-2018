## Other Deliverables

- Students are required to **participate** actively in the course, including meaningful contributions in group work, in-class participation, completion of "minute paper" forms after several classes, emails to 431-help, visits to TAs, etc. We're more concerned about the breadth of your participation rather than just its quantity. Most students score between 80% and 100% on this element.
- Students are required to complete two **quizzes**. Quiz [details are found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/quizzes).
- Students are required to complete two **project** assignments. Project [details are found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects).

## Grading

The final course grade is weighted as follows:

- 15% Class Participation / Group Work
- 25% Eight Homework Assignments
- 25% Two Quizzes
- 35% Two Projects, including the Final Portfolio Presentation
