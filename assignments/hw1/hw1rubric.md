# 432 Homework 1 Grading Rubric - Spring 2018

# Question 1. (40 points)

- 30 points for successfully creating a table one stratified appropriately 
- 10 points for giving a conclusion comparing both groups (including all the variables)
- A reasonable but unsuccessful attempt at the table will receive no more than 20 points

# Question 2. (30 points)

- 10 points for developing an correct plot or plots (labeled correctly) showing the sbp, bpmed and practice.
- 15 points for developing two models (one with interaction and one withour interaction)
- 5 points for appropriate conclusion comparing variation and significance in both models (the interaction is either significant, or accounts for a large fraction of the variation in the SBP values)
- A reasonable but unsuccessful attempt at the table will receive no more than 20 points

# Question 3 (25 points)

- 15 points for developing the new model using the model without interaction.
- 5 points for ploting residuals vs. fitted values and influential points and provide an explanation of the graph.
- 5 points for appropriate conclusion comparing both models 
    + Does it change the nature of the conclusions you can draw from the model? (the adjustment for `age` does not change the fundamental conclusions from the no-interaction model. Specifically, we continue to see a significant effect of both `practice` (with B showing lower SBPs) and `bpmed` (with those not prescribed such a medication having smaller SBPs.)
- A reasonable but unsuccessful attempt at the table will receive no more than 20 points

# Question 4. (5 points)

- 5 points for providing the GitHub name.
