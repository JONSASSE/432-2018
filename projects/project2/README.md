- Dr. Love will discuss these instructions in class on 2018-03-27.
- A substantial update to the document (Section 6: Some Additional Comments) happened on 2018-03-30.
- A small update on spending degrees of freedom (Section 6.19) was added on 2018-04-18.

## There are Three Deliverables for Project 2

1. By **April 17 at 5 PM**, you need to complete [**this form**](https://goo.gl/forms/Zfgnq5pyAAzAlmUm1) to register your project and specify presentation times for which you are available. Dr. Love will either approve or reject your project, and once he approves it, you can proceed. The form requires your project title, list of research questions, and details on your data set. You are not required to provide Dr. Love (or anyone else) with your data for Project 2. The available presentation times are listed on [the form](https://goo.gl/forms/Zfgnq5pyAAzAlmUm1), and [below](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/README.md#available-times-for-presentations).
    - You can see the status (and title) of proposals that have been reviewed and approved [by visiting this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/APPROVED.md).

2. You will use one of two available [templates for Project 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project2) and R Markdown to build an **HTML portfolio of materials**. This includes some background, your research questions, your data management work and codebook, and then your analytic work, data descriptions, results and conclusions. You will submit your R Markdown and HTML files [via canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) and these are due **three hours before your scheduled presentation time** on May 3, 7, or 8. 
    - Note that **if you and Dr. Love determine during your presentation that changes are required**, then you will turn in your final R Markdown and HTML files [via canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) by **noon on May 9**, regardless of when you gave your presentation. Based on previous years, most projects require either minor changes or no changes at all. 

3. You need to give a **presentation of your portfolio** to Dr. Love, on either May 3, May 7 or May 8 in his office (Wood WG-82L.) Your presentation time will be finalized on April 19.

## The Required Templates

Dr. Love built two templates, using the `rmdformats` package. Use whichever one you prefer.

- Template A uses the same formatting structure built on the `readthedown` template that you used in 432 Project 1.
    - Here is the [R Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/projects/project2/project2-templateA-432-2018.Rmd) for Template A, and you can also [view the HTML result](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/project2-templateA-432-2018.html).
- Template B builds on the `html_clean` template, which is also used in the Project 2 Instructions.
    - Here is the [R Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/projects/project2/project2-templateB-432-2018.Rmd) for Template B, and you can also [view the HTML result](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/project2-templateB-432-2018.html).
- The [cardiac.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/projects/project2/cardiac.csv) file was used in these templates to help fix ideas.

Use the template well. When you submit your project to Canvas,
- include your name in the file name, rather than retaining the original template's name
- remove all of the sample text in the template and instructions that I included to help you decide where things go,
- spell-check your work, and have someone else look it over for typographical errors and errors in grammar or syntax, or statements that are unclear.
- An alternate template or formatting style is acceptable only if it:
    - contains all of the content in these templates, including the restrictions
    - and uses a **dynamic** and attractive table of contents, as these do. A dynamic table of contents adjusts to account for the section of the work you're working with, and is not merely a floating table of contents.
