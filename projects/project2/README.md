# 432 Project 2 Instructions

Project 2 Instructions are available in this HTML document, and here's the R Markdown file used to generate them.

- Dr. Love will discuss these instructions in class on 2017-03-27.

## There are Three Deliverables for Project 2

1. By **April 17 at 5 PM**, you need to complete [**this form**]() to register your project and specify presentation times for which you are available. Dr. Love will either approve or reject your project, and once he approves it, you can proceed. The form requires your project title, list of research questions, and details on your data set. You are not required to provide Dr. Love (or anyone else) with your data for Project 2.

2. You will use one of two available [templates for Project 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project2) and R Markdown to build an HTML portfolio of materials. This includes some background, your research questions, your data management work and codebook, and then your analytic work, data descriptions, results and conclusions. You will submit your R Markdown and HTML files [via canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) and it is due **three hours before your scheduled presentation time** on May 3, 7, or 8. 
    - Note that if you and Dr. Love determine during your presentation that changes are required, then you will turn in your final R Markdown and HTML files [via canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) by noon on May 9, regardless of when you gave your presentation. Based on previous years, most projects require either minor changes or no changes at all. 

3. You need to give a **presentation of your portfolio** to Dr. Love, on either May 3, May 7 or May 8 in his office (Wood WG-82L.) Your presentation time will be finalized on April 19.

## The Required Templates

Dr. Love built two templates, using the `rmdformats` package. Use whichever one you prefer.

- Template A uses the same formatting structure built on the `readthedown` template that you used in 432 Project 1.
- Template B builds on the `html_clean` template, which is also used in the Project 2 Instructions.

An alternate template or formatting style is acceptable so long as it:

- contains all of the content in these templates, including the restrictions
- and uses a dynamic and attractive table of contents, as these do.
