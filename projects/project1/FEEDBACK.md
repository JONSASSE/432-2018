# Post-Project 1 Feedback from Dr. Love

## Grades

The mean score on Project 1 was just over 85%, and the median was also just over 85%. 

- The standard deviation was low, at about 4.5 percentage points. There were a lot of projects in the 80s.
- Scores between 70 and 86 seemed like "B" projects to me, and about 5/8 of the class fell in this range.
- Scores of 88 to 92 (note: no one scored 87) seemed like "A" projects to me. 
- 92 was the highest score on Project 1.

Your grade on Project 1 is a percentage, based on the following elements, on which there were 120 available points:

- up to 20 points for work prior to the final portfolio, which includes the proposal and drafts for the working groups
    - Everyone got 20/20
- up to 5 points for meeting the deadline for the final portfolio
    - Most got 5/5
- up to 20 points for tasks 1-9 in your final portfolio
- up to 20 points for task 10 (linear regression) in your final portfolio
- up to 20 points for task 11 (logistic regression) in your final portfolio
- up to 20 points for task 12 (conclusions and reflection) in your final portfolio
    - For tasks 1-9, 10, 11 and 12, a project with nothing especially strong or weak and no serious problems got 17/20.
    - Most grades in each section fell between 14 and 18. No one scored 20 on any section, but there were a few 19s.
- up to 15 points for the quality of the project portfolio's HTML presentation
    - Statistics is a details business. Everyone had something that was a problem, some small, some not small.
    - A presentation with no problems at all - meaning a completely clean description of everything that was needed, including only the necessary code and output, without extraneous materials, spelling or grammatical errors, etc. - would have gotten 15/15. 
    - There were no 15s, and only one or two 14s. Most grades on this metric were between 10 and 13.

Add up those points and divide by 1.2 to get your score on the project.
