# Projects for 432, Spring 2018

There are two projects due this semester.

1. Project 1 is due at noon on Monday 2018-03-19. It involves building a linear and logistic model for interesting data. What you need to do is highly structured, and the projects will be reviewed by your colleagues as you're doing them. 

- [Details on Project 1 are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project1).
- A sample Project 1 will be available for your review soon.

2. Project 2 is due as part of a final portfolio at noon on Wednesday 2018-05-09, but students will present their portfolios on 2018-05-03, 2018-05-07 or 2018-05-08. Dates for portfolio presentations will be determined in late March and announced 2018-04-03. This is a much more open-ended activity, and you will be largely responsible for making decisions about how best to present your work. [Details on Project 2 are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project2).
