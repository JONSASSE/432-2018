# Projects for 432, Spring 2018

There are two projects due this semester.

1. Project 1 is due at 1 PM on Friday 2018-03-23, and will be a big part of your life starting in early February. It involves building a linear and logistic model for interesting data. What you need to do is highly structured, and the projects will be reviewed by your colleagues as you're doing them. 

- [Details on Project 1 are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project1).
