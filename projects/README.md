# Projects for 432, Spring 2018

There are two projects due this semester.

1. Project 1 is due at 1 PM on Friday 2018-03-23, and will be a big part of your life starting in early February. It involves building a linear and logistic model for interesting data. What you need to do is highly structured, and the projects will be reviewed by your colleagues as you're doing them. 

- [Details on Project 1 are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project1).
- A [sample Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project1#sample-project-proposal) including both proposal materials and the analytic materials [is now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project1#sample-project-proposal).

2. Project 2 is due as part of a final portfolio at noon on Wednesday 2018-05-09, but students will present their portfolios on 2018-05-03, 2018-05-07 or 2018-05-08. Dates for portfolio presentations will be determined in late March and announced 2018-04-03. This is a much more open-ended activity, and you will be largely responsible for making decisions about how best to present your work. [Details on Project 2 will be available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project2) in mid-March.
