# Survival Analysis / Cox Regression

## A Survival Analysis Example

Source: Chen and Peace (2011) *Clinical Trial Data Analysis Using R*, CRC Press, section 5.1

```{r data}
brca <- read.csv("data/breast_cancer.csv") %>% tbl_df
```


## The `brca` trial

The `brca` data describes a parallel randomized trial of three treatments, adjuvant to surgery in the treatment of patients with stage-2 carcinoma of the breast. The three treatment groups are:

- `S+CT` = Surgery plus one year of chemotherapy
- `S+IT` = Surgery plus one year of immunotherapy
- `S+CT+IT` = Surgery plus one year of chemotherapy and immunotherapy

The measure of efficacy were "time to death" in weeks. In addition to `treat`, our variables are:

- `trial_weeks`: time in the study, in weeks, to death or censoring
- `last_alive`: 1 if alive at last follow-up (and thus censored), 0 if dead
- `age`: age in years at the start of the trial

## `brca` tibble

```{r, echo = FALSE}
brca
```

## Analytic Objectives

This is a typical right-censored survival data set with interest in the comparative analysis of the three treatments.

1. Does immunotherapy added to surgery plus chemotherapy improve survival? (Comparing S+CT+IT to S+CT)
2. Does chemotherapy add efficacy to surgery plus immunotherapy? (S+CT+IT vs. S+IT)
3. What is the effect of age on survival?

## Create survival object

- `trial_weeks`: time in the study, in weeks, to death or censoring
- `last_alive`: 1 if alive at last follow-up (and thus censored), 0 if dead

So `last_alive` = 0 if the event (death) occurs.

```{r}
brca$S <- with(brca, Surv(trial_weeks, last_alive == 0))

head(brca$S)
```

## Build Kaplan-Meier Estimator

```{r}
kmfit <- survfit(S ~ treat, dat = brca)

print(kmfit, print.rmean = TRUE)
```

## `summary(kmfit)`

![](figures/fig1.png)

## K-M Plot via `survminer`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggsurvplot(kmfit, data = brca,
           risk.table = TRUE,
           risk.table.height = 0.25,
           xlab = "Time in weeks")
```

## K-M Plot via `survminer` (code)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsurvplot(kmfit, data = brca,
           risk.table = TRUE,
           risk.table.height = 0.25,
           xlab = "Time in weeks")
```

## Testing the difference between curves

```{r}
survdiff(S ~ treat, dat = brca)
```

What do we conclude?

## Fit Cox Model A: Treatment alone

```{r}
modA <- coxph(S ~ treat, data = brca)
modA
```

## `summary(modA)`

![](figures/fig2.png)

## Check Proportional Hazards Assumption

```{r}
cox.zph(modA)
```

## Graphical PH Test `ggcoxzph(cox.zph(modA))`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggcoxzph(cox.zph(modA))
```

## Fit Cox Model B: Treatment + Age

```{r}
modB <- coxph(S ~ treat + age, data = brca)
modB
```

## `summary(modB)`

![](figures/fig3.png)

## Proportional Hazards Assumption: Model B Check

```{r}
cox.zph(modB)
```

## Graphical PH Test `ggcoxzph(cox.zph(modB))`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggcoxzph(cox.zph(modB))
```

## What to do if the PH assumption is violated

- If the PH assumption fails on a categorical predictor, fit a Cox model stratified by that predictor (use `strata(var)` rather than `var` in the specification of the `coxph` model.)
- If the PH assumption is violated, this means the hazard isn't constant over time, so we could fit separate Cox models for a series of time intervals.
- Use an extension of the Cox model that permits covariates to vary over time.

# Using Restricted Cubic Splines

## Explaining a Model with a Restricted Cubic Spline

Restricted cubic splines are an easy way to include an explanatory variable in a smooth and non-linear fashion in your model.

- The number of knots, k, are specified in advance, and this is the key issue to determining what the spline will do. We could use AIC to select k, or follow the general idea that for small n, k should be 3, for large n, k should be 5, and so often k = 4.
- The location of those knots is not important in most situations, so R places knots by default where the data exist, at fixed quantiles of the predictor's distribution.
- The "restricted" piece means that the tails of the spline (outside the outermost knots) behave in a linear fashion.

## The "Formula" from a Model with a Restricted Cubic Spline

- The best way to demonstrate what a spline does is to draw a picture of it. When in doubt, do that: show us how the spline affects the predictions made by the model. 
- But you can get a model equation for the spline out of R (heaven only knows what you would do with it.) Use the `latex` function in the `rms` package, for instance.

## An Example

```{r}
d <- datadist(iris)
options(datadist = "d")
m1 <- ols(Sepal.Length ~ rcs(Petal.Length, 4) + Petal.Width,
          data = iris, x = TRUE, y = TRUE)
m1
```

## `Function(m1)`

```{r}
Function(m1)
```

## What's in `Function(m1)`?

```
4.72 + 0.243  * Petal.Length 
     + 0.022  * pmax( Petal.Length-1.3,  0)^3 
     - 0.038  * pmax( Petal.Length-3.33, 0)^3 
     + 0.0003 * pmax( Petal.Length-4.8,  0)^3 
     + 0.016  * pmax( Petal.Length-6.1,  0)^3 
     - 0.334  * Petal.Width
```

where `pmax` is the maximum of the arguments inside its parentheses.

# Asssessing the Quality of a Logistic Regression Model

## A Quick Example

SOURCE: Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) Applied Logistic Regression: Second Edition. These data are copyrighted by John Wiley & Sons Inc. and must be acknowledged and used accordingly. Data were collected at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts during 1986.

```{r}
# uses aplore3 package for data set
lbw <- aplore3::lowbwt
head(lbw,3)
```

## Fit a logistic regression model

```{r}
model_10 <- glm(low ~ lwt + ptl + ht, 
                data = lbw, family = binomial)
model_10
```

## What is this model predicting, exactly?

```{r}
levels(lbw$low)
lbw %>% count(low)
```

The model predicts the probability of a LOW birth weight, because < 2500 g is listed second here.

- Our `model_10` is a model fit to y = 1 when low < 2500 g
- If y = 1 indicated that low >= 2500 g, this would be the opposite of our `model_10`.

## Proving the direction of `model_10`

```{r}
lbw <- lbw %>% mutate(y1 = ifelse(low == "< 2500 g", 1, 0),
               y2 = ifelse(low == ">= 2500 g", 1, 0))
mod_1 <- glm(y1 ~ lwt + ptl + ht, 
                data = lbw, family = binomial)
mod_2 <- glm(y2 ~ lwt + ptl + ht, 
                data = lbw, family = binomial)
```

- `mod_1` predicts Pr(birth weight < 2500 g)
- `mod_2` predicts Pr(birth weight >= 2500 g)

## So, what does `model_10` predict?

- `mod_1` predicts Pr(birth weight < 2500 g)
- `mod_2` predicts Pr(birth weight >= 2500 g)

```{r}
head(fitted(mod_1),3)
head(fitted(mod_2),3)
head(fitted(model_10),3)
```

## Classification Table for this Model

```{r}
table(fitted(model_10) >= 0.5, lbw$low)
```
