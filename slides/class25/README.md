## Key Materials

- The [slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class25) will be posted as soon as they are available.

Today's class will conclude our discussion of Cox proportional hazards regression models. As a reminder, Chapters 22 and 23 of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) describe the main ideas behind Cox proportional hazards regression models incorporating covariates that do not change over time.

Links to the data visualization we'll discuss today are coming soon.

## Announcements at the start of class

1. The Homework 6 Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric is now posted as an [HTML document you can view](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw6/hw6sketch.html), and as an [R Markdown file you can download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/assignments/hw6/hw6sketch.Rmd).

2. Remember that a draft version of both Chapters 22 and 23 where all images appear is available. See [the HTML here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/slides/class24/chapters_22_and_23_draft.html), and [the R Markdown here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/slides/class24/chapters_22_and_23_draft.Rmd).

3. A tip for your project 2. Most students should wind up using between 4 and 10 R packages in the project. 

- Everyone, I think, will need to load `skimr`, `broom`, `rms` and the `tidyverse`. 
- It's OK to load more, but **don't** load something else unless you actually need it. Don't just load everything we've used this semester. 
- Remember that `tidyverse` loads `forcats`, so you shouldn't load `forcats` if you're loading `tidyverse`. Similarly, `rms` loads `Hmisc`, so you don't need to load that separately. 
- There's really no reason for you to source in `Love-boost.R`, unless you actually need it to do something specific.
