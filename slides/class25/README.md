Today's class will conclude our discussion of Cox proportional hazards regression models. As a reminder, Chapters 22 and 23 of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) describe the main ideas behind Cox proportional hazards regression models incorporating covariates that do not change over time.

Links to the data visualization we'll discuss today are coming soon.
