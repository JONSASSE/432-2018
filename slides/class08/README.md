### Key Materials

[The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class08) are posted above, and the [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class08) will be posted as soon as they are available.

In today's class, we'll introduce the logistic regression model. We'll cover all of Chapter 12 and some of Chapter 13 in the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/). Next week, we'll finish that logistic regression material, then move forward to look at Chapter 10's material on using `ols` to fit linear models.
