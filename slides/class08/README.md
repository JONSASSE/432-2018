# 432 Class 08: 2018-02-08

### Key Materials

[The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class08) are posted above, and the [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class08) will be posted as soon as they are available.

In today's class, we'll introduce the logistic regression model. We'll cover all of Chapter 12 and some of Chapter 13 in the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/). Next week, we'll finish that logistic regression material, then move forward to look at Chapter 10's material on using `ols` to fit linear models.

## Announcements Before Class 08

1. [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw3) is due at 1 PM on Friday 2018-02-09.

2. The [Minute Paper after Class 08](https://goo.gl/forms/IRPizcTN8Y7k8Y2f1) is now available. Please complete this by 10 AM on Monday 2018-02-12.

3. Your [project 1 proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project1/README.md#the-proposal) is due the following Monday, 2018-02-19 at noon. Submit it via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
    - There is now a complete sample **project** (not just the proposal) available now, built using the template, by Dr. Love. This adds the Analyses (Section 10 on Linear Regression and Section 11 on Logistic Regression) to the sample Proposal document. This example was mostly built in Spring 2017, and the code here has largely NOT been updated to reflect changes in the way I am teaching 432 this year. See the note in Section 0.1 of [the HTML file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project1/example-project-432-spring2018.html).
        - You can get the full sample project's `example-project-432-spring2018.Rmd` [markdown file used to generate the results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/projects/project1/example-project-432-spring2018.Rmd), and you can [view the full project HTML result](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project1/example-project-432-spring2018.html).
        - You can get the `cardiac.dat` data used in the sample project at [the Data and Code page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/data-and-code).

4. I've added considerable material to the [Texts page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/texts) to provide some suggestions (including several downloadable books) which may help you move forward.
    - In particular, I built a [Google Drive folder which you can access via CWRU](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vN8dfqtz-hGyu7hrsPpBRnJptKI1B0BV?usp=sharing) containing several items.
