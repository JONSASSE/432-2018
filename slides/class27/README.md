# 432 Class 27: 2018-04-24

## Key Materials

- The [slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class27) are now available.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class27) will be posted as soon as possible.

In today's class, I will be talking about:

1. scientific replicability and statistical significance
2. retrospective power, Type S and Type M errors

There's no real discussion of data visualization today, for which I'm sorry, but the other material overwhelms. 
- However, I will direct you to [Junk Charts](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/) by Kaiser Fung, who also runs a great [blog on Big Data called Numbers Rule Your World](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/). I recommend them both.

## Announcements at the start of class

1. Joseph Rickert put together a great post called [Survival Analysis with R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/09/25/survival-analysis-with-r/) which has a nice demonstration of a few useful models, and many links to excellent resources for future study. I'll definitely use this in building up next year's version of the survival material.

2. The Schedule of Project 2 Presentations (and some logistical information) [is available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/PRESENTATIONS.md). Please take a look now, to verify that the time you're scheduled for works.

3. [Homework 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw7) is due today at 5. I posted a hint for question 3 last week. 

4. I gave a talk earlier this year on ["Rethinking Statistical Significance"](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/rethink). Slides, an audio recording and a more complete batch of references (including most of those cited today) can be found there.
    - In the README for today's class [posted three articles](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class26) that are of particular importance, but many other things are linked from that other talk, if you're interested.
    - In today's slides, I refer to [Roger Peng's blog post from last week](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/04/17/what-is-a-successful-data-analysis/) about what makes a data analysis successful.
    - In today's slides, I also refer to the [Hack Your Way to Scientific Glory](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/) game at FiveThirtyEight.
