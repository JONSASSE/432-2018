2. [Homework 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw7) is due today at 5. I posted a hint for question 3 last week. 

3. I gave a talk earlier this year on ["Rethinking Statistical Significance"](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/rethink). Slides, an audio recording and a more complete batch of references (including most of those cited today) can be found there.
    - In the README for today's class [posted three articles](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class26) that are of particular importance, but many other things are linked from that other talk, if you're interested.
    - In today's slides, I refer to [Roger Peng's blog post from last week](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/04/17/what-is-a-successful-data-analysis/) about what makes a data analysis successful.
    - In today's slides, I also refer to the [Hack Your Way to Scientific Glory](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/) game at FiveThirtyEight.
