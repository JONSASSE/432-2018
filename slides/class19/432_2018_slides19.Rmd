## Today's Materials

Regression Models for Count Outcomes

- Poisson Regression model

- Zero-inflated models

# The `medicare` data

## The `medicare` example

The data we will use come from the `NMES1988` data set in R's `AER` package, although I have built a cleaner version for you in the `medicare.csv` file on our web site. These are essentially the same data as are used in [\textcolor{blue}{my main resource}](http://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-hurdle-models/) from the University of Virginia for hurdle models.

These data are a cross-section originating from the US National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) conducted in 1987 and 1988. The NMES is based upon a representative, national probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population and individuals admitted to long-term care facilities during 1987. The data are a subsample of individuals ages 66 and over all of whom are covered by Medicare (a public insurance program providing substantial protection against health-care costs), and some of whom also have private supplemental insurance.

```{r}
medicare <- read.csv("medicare.csv") %>% tbl_df
```

# Model 1: A Poisson Regression

## Poisson Regression

Assume our count data (`visits`) follows a Poisson distribution with a mean conditional on our predictors.

```{r}
mod_1 <- glm(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
              data = medicare, family = "poisson")
```

Remember the sample size here. Is statistical significance going to be our problem?

## Model 1 (Poisson Regression)

```{r}
mod_1
```

## `tidy(mod_1)` with rounding and p values

```{r}
tidy(mod_1, conf.int = F) %>% 
    kable(format = "pandoc", digits = 2)
```

## `tidy(mod_1)` with rounding and CI

```{r}
tidy(mod_1, conf.int = T) %>% 
    select(-statistic, -p.value) %>%
    kable(format = "pandoc", digits = 2)
```

## Interpret the `male` and `chronic` variables

We have an additive model in the `log(visits)` scale.

- Coefficient of `male` is -0.11, with 95% CI (-0.14, -0.09)
    - If Harry and Sally share the same values for all other variables in the model, but Harry is male and Sally is female, then log(visits) for Harry is estimated to be -0.11 smaller than log(visits) for Sally.

- Coefficient of `chronic` is 0.15, with 95% CI (0.14, 0.16)
    - If Harry and Steve share the same values for all other variables in the model, but Harry has one more chronic illness than Steve, then log(visits) for Harry is estimated to be 0.15 larger than log(visits) for Steve.


## The Fitted Equation

$$\begin{array}{cc}
log(\mbox{ visits }) = 1.03 + 0.16 \mbox{ hospital } - 0.36 (\mbox{ health = excellent }) + \\
0.25 (\mbox{ health = poor }) + 0.15 \mbox{ chronic } - 0.11 (\mbox{ sex = male }) \\
+ 0.03 \mbox{ school } + 0.20 (\mbox{ insurance = yes})
\end{array}$$

So, the count of visits follows a Poisson distribution, with mean $\lambda$, where:

$$\begin{array}{cc}
\lambda = exp[1.03 + 0.16 \mbox{ hospital } - 0.36 (\mbox{ health = excellent }) + \\
0.25 (\mbox{ health = poor }) + 0.15 \mbox{ chronic } - 0.11 (\mbox{ sex = male }) \\
+ 0.03 \mbox{ school } + 0.20 (\mbox{ insurance = yes})]
\end{array}$$

## Expressing the model differently

```{r}
tidy(mod_1, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T) %>% 
    select(-statistic, -p.value) %>%
    kable(format = "pandoc", digits = 2)
```

## Interpret the `male` and `chronic` after exponentiation

Now, we have a multiplicative model in the `visits` scale.

- exp(`male`) is 0.89, with 95% CI (0.87, 0.92)
    - If Harry and Sally share the same values for all other variables in the model, but Harry is male and Sally is female, then visits for Harry is estimated to be 0.89 times the visits for Sally. Harry is expected to have 89% of the visits Sally has.

- exp(`chronic`) is 1.16, with 95% CI (1.15, 1.17)
    - If Harry and Steve share the same values for all other variables in the model, but Harry has one more chronic illness than Steve, then visits for Harry is estimated to be 1.16 times visits for Steve. Harry is expected to have 116% of the visits Steve has.

## `display(mod_1)` from `arm` package

```{r}
display(mod_1)
```

## `summary(mod_1)`

![](figures/fig2.png)

## `confint(mod_1)`

```{r}
confint(mod_1)
```

## Testing the Predictors

- Wald tests are provided with the Poisson regression summary.
- ANOVA approach lets us do sequential likelihood ratio tests.

![](figures/fig3.png)

## Making Predictions

```{r}
medicare %>% head(2)
```

## Store Predictions

```{r}
mod_1_aug <- augment(mod_1, medicare, 
                     type.predict = "response",
                     type.residuals = "response")

mod_1_aug %>% select(visits, .fitted, .resid) %>% head(2)
```

## Calculating a Pseudo-R^2^ for `mod_1`

```{r}
(mod_1_r <- with(mod_1_aug, cor(visits, .fitted)))
(mod_1_r^2)
```

### Summarizing the Model's Fit

```{r}
glance(mod_1)
```


## Rootogram: See the Fit (using default choices)

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_1)
```

## Interpreting the Hanging Rootogram

- The red curved line is the theoretical Poisson fit. 
- "Hanging" from each point on the red line is a bar, the height of which represents the difference between expected and observed counts. 
    - A bar hanging below 0 indicates underfitting. (In this case, this refers to when our predict fewer values than the data show.)
    - A bar hanging above 0 indicates overfitting. (In this case, this refers to when our model predicts more values than the data show.)
- The counts have been transformed with a square root transformation to prevent smaller counts from getting obscured and overwhelmed by larger counts. 

## The Complete Hanging Rootogram for Model 1

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_1, max = 90, 
                    main = "Rootogram for Poisson mod_1")
```

## Interpreting the Rootogram for Model 1

In `mod_1`, we see a great deal of underfitting for counts of 0 and 1, then overfitting for visit counts in the 3-10 range, with some underfitting again at more than a dozen or so visits.

- Our Poisson model (`mod_1`) doesn't fit enough zeros or ones, and fits too many 3-12 values, then not enough of the higher values.

## How many zero counts does Model 1 predict?

```{r}
lam <- predict(mod_1, type = "response") # exp. mean count
exp <- sum(dpois(x = 0, lambda = lam)) # sum the prob(0)
round(exp)
```

### How many subjects with zero visits did we see?

```{r}
medicare %>% count(visits == 0)
```

## Do we have an overdispersion problem?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
yhat <- predict(mod_1, type = "response")
n <- 4406; k <- 8
z <- (mod_1_aug$visits - mod_1_aug$.fitted) / 
    sqrt(mod_1_aug$.fitted)
cat("overdispersion ratio is ", sum(z^2)/ (n - k), "\n")
cat("p value of overdispersion test: ", 
    pchisq(sum(z^2), df = n-k, lower.tail = FALSE), "\n")
```

## Code used on previous slide

```{r, eval = FALSE}
yhat <- predict(mod_1, type = "response")
n <- 4406; k <- 8 # use display(mod_1) to see these
z <- (mod_1_aug$visits - mod_1_aug$.fitted) / 
    sqrt(mod_1_aug$.fitted)
cat("overdispersion ratio is ", sum(z^2)/ (n - k), "\n")
cat("p value of overdispersion test: ", 
    pchisq(sum(z^2), df = n-k, lower.tail = FALSE), "\n")
```

## `glm.diag.plots` from `boot` for Model 1

```{r, echo = FALSE}
boot::glm.diag.plots(mod_1)
```

# The Negative Binomial Model (mod_2)

## Fitting the Negative Binomial Model

Looks like our data are overdispersed compared to what a Poisson model expects.

```{r}
mod_2 <- MASS::glm.nb(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
              data = medicare)
```

## Rootogram for Negative Binomial Model

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_2, max = 90, 
                    main = "Rootogram for Model mod_2")
```

## Save predicted values and residuals

```{r}
mod_2_aug <- medicare %>%
    mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_2, type = "response"),
           resid = resid(mod_2, type = "response"))

mod_2_aug %>% 
    dplyr::select(visits, fitted, resid) %>%
    head(2)
```

## Pseudo-R^2^ for Neg. Bin. model (`mod_2`)

We can calculate a proxy for R^2^ as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values.

```{r}
mod2_r <- with(mod_2_aug, cor(visits, fitted))
mod2_r^2
```

# What is a Zero-Inflated Model?

## Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model

The zero-inflated Poisson or (ZIP) model is used to describe count data with an excess of zero counts. 

The model posits that there are two processes involved:

- a logit model is used to predict excess zeros
- while a Poisson model is used to predict the counts

The `pscl` package is used here, which can conflict with the `countreg` package we used to fit rootograms. 

## Fitting the ZIP model (Model `mod_3`)

```{r}
mod_3 <- zeroinfl(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
              data = medicare)
```

## Count model coefficients in `mod_3`

![](figures/fig6.png)

## The Fitted Equation (part 1 of 2)

The form of the model equation for a zero-inflated Poisson regression requires us to take two separate models into account. 

First, we have a logistic regression model to predict the log odds of zero visits...

```
logit(visits = 0) = -0.08 - 0.30 hospital + 
             0.24 health = excellent + 0.21 health = poor - 
             0.53 chronic + 0.42 sex = male - 0.06 school - 
             0.75 insurance = yes
```

That takes care of the *extra* zeros.

## The Fitted Equation (part 2 of 2)

The form of the model equation for a zero-inflated Poisson regression requires us to take two separate models into account. 

Second, we have a Poisson regression model to predict log(visits)...

```
log(visits) = 1.41 + 0.16 hospital - 
             0.30 health = excellent + 0.25 health = poor + 
             0.10 chronic - 0.06 sex = male + 0.02 school + 
             0.08 insurance = yes
```

This may produce some additional zero count estimates.

## Rootogram for ZIP model

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_3, max = 90,
                    main = "ZIP model Rootogram: mod_3")
```

## Save predicted values and residuals

```{r}
mod_3_aug <- medicare %>%
    mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_3, type = "response"),
           resid = resid(mod_3, type = "response"))

mod_3_aug %>% 
    dplyr::select(visits, fitted, resid) %>%
    head(2)
```

## Is ZIP significantly better than Poisson (Vuong test)

```{r}
vuong(mod_3, mod_1)
```

## Pseudo-R^2^ for ZIP model (`mod_3`)

We can calculate a proxy for R2 as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values.

```{r}
mod3_r <- with(mod_3_aug, cor(visits, fitted))
mod3_r^2
```

# The Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Model 

## Fitting the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (`mod_4`)

```{r}
mod_4 <- zeroinfl(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
              dist = "negbin", data = medicare)
```

## Rootogram for ZINB model

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_4, max = 90,
                    main = "ZINB model Rootogram: mod_4")
```

## Save predicted values and residuals

```{r}
mod_4_aug <- medicare %>%
    mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_4, type = "response"),
           resid = resid(mod_4, type = "response"))

mod_4_aug %>% 
    dplyr::select(visits, fitted, resid) %>%
    head(2)
```

## Is ZINB significantly better than Negative Binomial?

```{r}
vuong(mod_4, mod_2)
```

## Pseudo-R^2^ for ZINB model (`mod_4`)

We can calculate a proxy for R2 as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values.

```{r}
mod4_r <- with(mod_4_aug, cor(visits, fitted))
mod4_r^2
```

## So Far ...

Model | Pseudo-R^2^ | Rootogram? | Comments
-------: | ------: | -----------: | -----------------------
Poisson | 0.099 | Many problems. | Data appear overdispersed.
Neg. Bin. | 0.083 | Better. | Still not enough zeros.
ZIP | 0.107 | All but 0 a problem. | Not enough 1-3.
ZINB | 0.096 | Better. | Zeros not a perfect fit. 

## Next Time - The Hurdle Model 

The hurdle model is a two-part model that specifies one process for zero counts and another process for positive counts. The idea is that positive counts occur once a threshold is crossed, or put another way, a hurdle is cleared. If the hurdle is not cleared, then we have a count of 0.

- The first part of the model is typically a binary logit model. This models whether an observation takes a positive count or not. 
- The second part of the model is usually a truncated Poisson or Negative Binomial model. Truncated means we're only fitting positive counts. If we were to fit a hurdle model to our [medicare] data, the interpretation would be that one process governs whether a patient visits a doctor or not, and another process governs how many visits are made.

## Next Time - The Tobit (Censored Regression) Model

The idea of the tobit model (sometimes called a censored regression model) is to estimate associations for outcomes where we can see either left-censoring (censoring from below) or right-censoring (censoring from above.)

We'll look at a different example for the tobit, since we don't have an upper bound (technically) for the visit counts in the `medicare` data.
