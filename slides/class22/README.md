# 432 Class 22: 2018-04-05

## Key Materials

- The [slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class22) are posted.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class22) will appear when available.
- We will meet in the auditorium (**E301**) today, down the hall from our usual E321-323.

Today's class will address a famous data visualization from history, and then we'll discuss building regression models for multi-categorical outcomes, using multinomial models. I also have another example available using proportional odds logistic regression at the end of today's slides.

An additional example of fitting a multinomial logistic model to predict a multi-categorical outcome is available in [Chapter 20 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/). 

- The example in that Chapter is based on the work of Jeffrey S. Simonoff (2003) Analyzing Categorical Data, in his Chapter 10. Related data and R code are available at http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jsimonof/AnalCatData/Splus/. 
- The data set and analysis are based on the work of Peng RD and Hengartner NW (2002) Quantitative analysis of literary styles, *The American Statistician*, 56, 175-185.

## New Materials

1. A reproduction of Charles Joseph Minard's map of Napoleon's disastrous losses suffered during the Russian campaign of 1812 that we'll look at today can be found [at this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard#/media/File:Minard.png), and in the [Minard_large.png file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/slides/class22/Minard_large.png) above.

2. [This is a nice cheat sheet](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Converting_data_between_wide_and_long_format/) to help in converting data from wide to long format.
