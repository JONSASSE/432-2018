# 432 Class 10: 2018-02-15

### Key Materials

- [The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class10) are posted above for our eventual discussion of linear regression using the `ols` function in the `rms` package. But I expect that the slides currently planned for Class 09 will take up at least some (if not all) of Class 10, as well. So these slides may well wind up being Class 11 material. 
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class10) will be posted as soon as they are available.

In today's class, we'll discuss the use of the `ols` function and related materials from `rms` and `Hmisc` in fitting linear regression models.
