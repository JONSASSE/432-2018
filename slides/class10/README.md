# 432 Class 10: 2018-02-15

## After Class

- I fixed a typo (AUC = 0.5, not 1) in Slide 23 and we got through slides 1-67. I will add Slides 68- to the materials for Class 11, but also leave them here.

### Key Materials

- [The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class10) are posted above. 
    - In Class 10, I'm going to introduce a new example, based on the [Framingham Heart Study](http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/). That way, you'll have three complete logistic regression examples using my 2018 methods, specifically:
        - the `lbw` example found in slides for class 9
        - a new example using the `fram_new` data above, found in the slides for class 10 (today)
        - and the `resect` example in the Course Notes, Chapter 13.
    - There are too many slides here for me to discuss them all in one session. We'll see how it goes.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class10) will be posted as soon as they are available.

In today's class, we'll continue our discussion of logistic regression, amplifying the material in [Chapter 13 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/logistic-regression-and-the-resect-data.html).
