# 432 Class 11: 2018-02-20

### Key Materials

- [The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class11) are posted above. They include some leftover materials from Class 10 on logistic regression, followed by a discussion of linear regression using the `ols` function in the `rms` package. 
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class10) will be posted as soon as they are available.

In today's class, we'll finish our discussion of the logistic regression models for the Framingham Heart Study that we began in Class 10. Then we'll discuss the use of the `ols` function and related materials from `rms` and `Hmisc` in fitting linear regression models, amplifying what you'll find in [Chapter 10 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/using-ols-from-the-rms-package-to-fit-linear-models.html).

## Announcements Before Class 11

1. [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw4) is due at 1 PM on Friday, 2018-02-23.

2. Your [project 1 proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project1/README.md#the-proposal) is also due at 1 PM on Friday, 2018-02-23.

3. A coding tip: If you filter a data set in R to focus on specific levels of a factor, R retains all of those factor levels by default. If this is a problem, use the `droplevels` function. [See here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32059343/when-filtering-with-dplyr-in-r-why-do-filtered-out-levels-of-a-variable-remain) for more details.
