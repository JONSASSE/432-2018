## Key Materials

- The [slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class26) will be posted as soon as possible.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class26) will be posted as soon as possible.

Today's class will include:

1. data visualization
2. some specific issues related to logistic regression model selection and classification assessment
3. some clarifying comments on spending degrees of freedom, the Spearman rho-squared plot, and how regression models should be built
4. some discussion of retrospective power, Type S and Type M errors
5. some discussion of broader issues in scientific replicability and statistical significance

which may continue on into Class 27. There is no Minute Paper today.

## Announcements at the start of class

1. The Project 2 [proposal status page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/APPROVED.md) is available for your review.
    - The **Project 2 Schedule** will be posted as soon as it is available.

2. I posted a hint for question 3 on [Homework 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw7). 
    - When you have a time-to-event outcome, you just use the survival time, and not the whole survival object (i.e. you ignore the censoring) in building a Spearman rho-squared plot.

3. The version of Chapters 22 and 23 where all images appear is [available in HTML here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/slides/class24/chapters_22_and_23_draft.html), and also [in R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/slides/class24/chapters_22_and_23_draft.Rmd).
