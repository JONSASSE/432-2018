### Key Materials

[The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class05), and the [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class05) will be posted above when they become available.

In today's class, we'll focus on model selection and validation.

## Announcements Before Class 05

1. R Studio version 1.1.419 is now [available for download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). You probably want to do so.

2. Homework 1 and Grading, in general. 
    - The [Homework 1 Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw1/README.md) is now available in R Markdown, HTML and PDF.
    - The [Grading Rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw1/README.md) is also available.
    - Once Homework 1 has been graded, we'll post grades and a few TA comments, in a list, with students identified by HW ID number.
        + You'll receive an email from Professor Love with your HW ID number in time to view the grades. Those of you who took 431 with Professor Love this past semester will have the same number as last term.
    - Should you have questions about the Homework's concepts or other **non-grading** issues, please contact us at 431-help or in office hours.
        + The TAs are available to help you understand an appropriate way to tackle each problem, and also to help you understand potential concerns related to your answer.
    - But if you have questions about **grading**, you'll submit those to Dr. Love for all homework assignments, in a batch.
        + Dr. Love will provide a Google Form to use for this task. He will review all such requests at the **end of the term**.
        + If you've already got an A in the course without any additional credit on homework assignments, then he won't bother to review those grading requests, but if you don't, he will do so carefully, at the end of the term.
        + Please **don't** expect the TAs to address grading issues: Dr. Love will do that, at the end of the semester.

3. We've corrected typos in Chapters 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/), all found by students. Thanks!
