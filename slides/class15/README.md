In today's class, we'll demonstrate five different robust linear regression modeling approaches, including bounded influence regression, penalized least squares and quantile regression. We'll also discuss Quiz 1.

## Announcements before class.

1. We will meet in Room E321-323 for the rest of the semester, **except for** April 5, when we'll meet in E301 again. Sorry about last Thursday. We're still not sure what happened.

2. I've posted the Homework 5 [grading rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw5/hw5rubric.md), as well as the Homework 5 [answer sketch in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw5/hw5sketch.pdf), and [in R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/assignments/hw5/hw5sketch.Rmd) and in an [HTML file you can preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw5/hw5sketch.html). We'll get the grades to you as soon as possible.
    - The original sketch imputed using all other variables, but the revised sketch adheres to the recommendation within the assignment that you only use two specific variables to impute. It has no meaningful effect on conclusions, and how you did the imputation is not part of the grading rubric.

3. You may be interested in this list of [50 `ggplot2` Visualizations (with R code)](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html) which also links to some more introductory materials. If you want to build a waffle chart, dumbbell chart, slope chart, show clusters, build maps, or many more things, this is a nice resource. Some of the tools it uses come from the `ggExtra` package.
