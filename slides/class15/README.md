## Announcements before class.

1. We will meet in Room E321-323 for the rest of the semester, **except for** April 5, when we'll meet in E301 again. Sorry about last Thursday. We're still not sure what happened.

2. I've posted the Homework 5 [grading rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw5/hw5rubric.md), as well as the Homework 5 [answer sketch in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw5/hw5sketch.pdf), and [in R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/assignments/hw5/hw5sketch.Rmd) and in an [HTML file you can preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw5/hw5sketch.html). We'll get the grades to you as soon as possible.

3. You may be interested in this list of [50 `ggplot2` Visualizations (with R code)](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html) which also links to some more introductory materials. If you want to build a waffle chart, dumbbell chart, slope chart, show clusters, build maps, or many more things, this is a nice resource. Some of the tools it uses come from the `ggExtra` package.
