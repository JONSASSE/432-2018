## Today's Goal

Predict `visits` using some combination of these 6 predictors...

Predictor | Description
---------: | ----------------------------------------------
`hospital` | number of hospital stays
`health`   | self-perceived health status (poor, average, excellent)
`chronic`  | number of chronic conditions
`sex`      | male or female
`school`   | number of years of education
`insurance` | is the subject (also) covered by private insurance? (yes or no)

# Model 1: A Poisson Regression

## Poisson Regression

Assume our count data (`visits`) follows a Poisson distribution with a mean conditional on our predictors.

```{r}
mod_1 <- glm(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
              data = medicare, family = "poisson")
```

## Store Predictions

```{r}
mod_1_aug <- augment(mod_1, medicare, 
                     type.predict = "response",
                     type.residuals = "response")

mod_1_aug %>% select(visits, .fitted, .resid) %>% head(2)
```

## Calculating a Pseudo-R^2^ for `mod_1`

```{r}
(mod_1_r <- with(mod_1_aug, cor(visits, .fitted)))
(mod_1_r^2)
```

### Summarizing the Model's Fit

```{r}
glance(mod_1)
```

## Building a Rootogram

To build a rootogram, you need to load the `countreg` package. This package is housed on R-Forge, rather than CRAN, so you need to install it with ...

```
install.packages("countreg", 
                     repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org") 
```

in order to use it.

## Rootogram: See the Fit (using default choices)

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_1)
```

## Interpreting the Hanging Rootogram

- The red curved line is the theoretical Poisson fit. 
- "Hanging" from each point on the red line is a bar, the height of which represents the difference between expected and observed counts. 
    - A bar hanging below 0 indicates that the model under-predicts that value. (Model predicts fewer values than the data show.)
    - A bar hanging above 0 indicates over-prediction of that value. (Model predicts more values than the data show.)
- The counts have been transformed with a square root transformation to prevent smaller counts from getting obscured and overwhelmed by larger counts. 

## How many zero counts does Model 1 predict?

```{r}
lam <- predict(mod_1, type = "response") # exp. mean count
exp <- sum(dpois(x = 0, lambda = lam)) # sum the prob(0)
round(exp)
```

### How many subjects with zero visits did we see?

```{r}
medicare %>% count(visits == 0)
```

## The Complete Hanging Rootogram for Model 1

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_1, max = 90, 
                    main = "Rootogram for Poisson mod_1")
```

## Interpreting the Rootogram for Model 1

In `mod_1`, we see a great deal of underfitting for counts of 0 and 1, then overfitting for visit counts in the 3-10 range, with some underfitting again at more than a dozen or so visits.

- Our Poisson model (`mod_1`) doesn't fit enough zeros or ones, and fits too many 3-12 values, then not enough of the higher values.


## Do we have an overdispersion problem?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
yhat <- predict(mod_1, type = "response")
n <- 4406; k <- 8
z <- (mod_1_aug$visits - mod_1_aug$.fitted) / 
    sqrt(mod_1_aug$.fitted)
cat("overdispersion ratio is ", sum(z^2)/ (n - k), "\n")
cat("p value of overdispersion test: ", 
    pchisq(sum(z^2)/(n-k), n-k), "\n")
```

### Dealing with Overdispersion?

To address the overdispersion, we'll adopt a negative binomial approach, in part because the rootogram tool we're using doesn't handle the quasipoisson model.

## Code used on previous slide

```{r, eval = FALSE}
yhat <- predict(mod_1, type = "response")
n <- 4406; k <- 8 # use display(mod_1) to see these
z <- (mod_1_aug$visits - mod_1_aug$.fitted) / 
    sqrt(mod_1_aug$.fitted)
cat("overdispersion ratio is ", sum(z^2)/ (n - k), "\n")
cat("p value of overdispersion test: ", 
    pchisq(sum(z^2)/(n-k), n-k), "\n")
```

## `glm.diag.plots` from `boot` for Model 1

```{r, echo = FALSE}
boot::glm.diag.plots(mod_1)
```

# Model 2: A Negative Binomial Model

## Fitting the Negative Binomial Model

Looks like our data are overdispersed compared to what a Poisson model expects.

```{r}
mod_2 <- MASS::glm.nb(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
              data = medicare)
```

## Rootogram for Negative Binomial Model

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_2, max = 90, 
                    main = "Rootogram for Model mod_2")
```

## Save predicted values and residuals

```{r}
mod_2_aug <- medicare %>%
    mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_2, type = "response"),
           resid = resid(mod_2, type = "response"))

mod_2_aug %>% 
    dplyr::select(visits, fitted, resid) %>%
    head(2)
```

## Pseudo-R^2^ for Neg. Bin. model (`mod_2`)

We can calculate a proxy for R^2^ as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values.

```{r}
mod2_r <- with(mod_2_aug, cor(visits, fitted))
mod2_r^2
```

## So Far ...

Model | Pseudo-R^2^ | Rootogram? | Comments
-------: | ------: | -----------: | -----------------------
Poisson | 0.099 | Many problems. | Data appear overdispersed.
Neg. Bin. | 0.083 | Better. | Still not enough zeros.

# Model 3: Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) Model

## Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model

The zero-inflated Poisson or (ZIP) model is used to describe count data with an excess of zero counts. 

The model posits that there are two processes involved:

- a logit model is used to predict excess zeros
- while a Poisson model is used to predict the counts

The `pscl` package is used to fit these zero-inflated models.

```{r}
mod_3 <- pscl::zeroinfl(visits ~ hospital + health + 
                    chronic + sex + school + insurance,
                    data = medicare)
```

## `summary(mod_3)` (and see next 2 slides)

![](figures/fig4.png)

## The Fitted Equation (part 1 of 2)

The form of the model equation for a zero-inflated Poisson regression requires us to take two separate models into account. 

First, we have a logistic regression model to predict the log odds of zero visits...

```
logit(visits = 0) = -0.08 - 0.30 hospital + 
             0.24 health = excellent + 0.21 health = poor - 
             0.53 chronic + 0.42 sex = male - 0.06 school - 
             0.75 insurance = yes
```

That takes care of the *extra* zeros.

## The Fitted Equation (part 2 of 2)

The form of the model equation for a zero-inflated Poisson regression requires us to take two separate models into account. 

Second, we have a Poisson regression model to predict log(visits)...

```
log(visits) = 1.41 + 0.16 hospital - 
             0.30 health = excellent + 0.25 health = poor + 
             0.10 chronic - 0.06 sex = male + 0.02 school + 
             0.08 insurance = yes
```

This may produce some additional zero count estimates.

## Rootogram for ZIP model

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_3, max = 90,
                    main = "ZIP model Rootogram: mod_3")
```

## Save predicted values and residuals

```{r}
mod_3_aug <- medicare %>%
    mutate(fitted = predict(mod_3, type = "response"),
           resid = resid(mod_3, type = "response"))

mod_3_aug %>% 
    dplyr::select(visits, fitted, resid) %>%
    head(2)
```

## Is ZIP significantly better than Poisson (Vuong test)

```{r}
vuong(mod_3, mod_1)
```

- Conclusion: ZIP model shows evidence of superiority over Poisson.
- Vuong QH (1989) Likelihood ratio tests for model selection and non-nested hypotheses. *Econometrica* 57:307-333.

## Pseudo-R^2^ for ZIP model (`mod_3`)

We can calculate a proxy for R^2^ as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values.

```{r}
mod3_r <- with(mod_3_aug, cor(visits, fitted))
mod3_r^2
```

# Model 4: Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Model 

## Fitting the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (`mod_4`)

```{r}
mod_4 <- zeroinfl(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
              dist = "negbin", data = medicare)
```

```{r}
countreg::rootogram(mod_4, max = 90,
                    main = "ZINB model Rootogram: mod_4")
```

## Save predicted values and residuals

```{r}
mod_4_aug <- medicare %>%
    mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_4, type = "response"),
           resid = resid(mod_4, type = "response"))

mod_4_aug %>% 
    dplyr::select(visits, fitted, resid) %>%
    head(2)
```

## Is ZINB significantly better than Negative Binomial?

```{r}
vuong(mod_4, mod_2)
```

## Pseudo-R^2^ for ZINB model (`mod_4`)

We can calculate a proxy for R^2^ as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values.

```{r}
mod4_r <- with(mod_4_aug, cor(visits, fitted))
mod4_r^2
```

# Model 5: The Hurdle Model (Poisson)

## The Hurdle Model 

The hurdle model is a two-part model that specifies one process for zero counts and another process for positive counts. The idea is that positive counts occur once a threshold is crossed, or put another way, a hurdle is cleared. If the hurdle is not cleared, then we have a count of 0.

- The first part of the model is typically a **binary logistic regression** model. This models whether an observation takes a positive count or not. 
- The second part of the model is usually a truncated Poisson or Negative Binomial model. Truncated means we're only fitting positive counts, and not zeros. 

In fitting a hurdle model to our [medicare] data, the interpretation would be that one process governs whether a patient visits a doctor or not, and another process governs how many visits are made.

## Fitting a Hurdle Model / Poisson-Logistic

```{r}
mod_5 <- hurdle(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
              dist = "poisson", zero.dist = "binomial", 
              data = medicare)
```

## The Fitted Equation

Logistic Regression to predict log odds of zero visits...

        + .06 school + .75 insurance = yes
```

```
log(visits) = max( 0, -1.4 + .15 hospital - .30 health = Exc

# Model 7: The Tobit (Censored Regression) Model

## The Tobit (Censored Regression) Model

The idea of the tobit model (sometimes called a censored regression model) is to estimate associations for outcomes where we can see either left-censoring (censoring from below) or right-censoring (censoring from above.) 

- Here, we might think of a broader latent (unobserved) variable that describes good health.
- We have censoring from below (at 0) where a person with good health (or better) has value 0.
- All of the people with better-than-good health take the same value (0) for visits.

The tobit model postulates that the value 0 in our model is just the lower limit of the underlying measure of poor physical health that we would actually observe in the population if we had a stronger measure. 

## Fitting the Tobit Model (uses `VGAM::vglm`)

```{r}
mod_7 <- vglm(visits ~ hospital + health + chronic +
                  sex + school + insurance,
                  tobit(Lower = 0), 
                  type.fitted = "censored", 
                  data = medicare)
```

## Detailed Coefficient Summary

![](figures/fig17.png)

## Confidence Intervals for Coefficients

![](figures/fig18.png)

## Fitted Equation

Using the `type.fitted = "censored"` approach, we'll get predictions limited to visit counts of 0 and larger. If the model below yields predicted visits < 0, we will fit 0. The model equation is:

```
visits = -0.33 + 1.74 hospital - 1.74 health = Excellent
       + 1.91 health = Poor + 1.22 chronic - 0.93 sex = M
       + 0.19 school + 1.68 insurance = yes
```

Tobit model regression coefficients are interpreted as we would a set of OLS coefficients, except that the linear effect is on the **uncensored latent variable**, rather than on the observed outcome.

## Save Fitted Values and Residuals

```{r}
mod_7_aug <- medicare %>%
    mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_7, type.fitted = "censored"),
           resid = visits - fitted)

mod_7_aug %>% 
    dplyr::select(visits, fitted, resid) %>%
    head(2)
```

## Rootogram? Not really. Table?

## Tables of Observed and Fitted `visits` from Tobit

```{r}
addmargins(table(round(mod_7_aug$fitted,0)))
```

```{r}
addmargins(table(mod_7_aug$visits))
```

## Plot?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mod_7_aug, aes(x = visits, y = round(fitted))) + 
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2) +
