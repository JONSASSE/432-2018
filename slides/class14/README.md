## Announcements Before Class 14

1. [Homework 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw5) is due this Friday, 2018-03-02 at 1 PM. 
    + In question 4, there was some confusion regarding my original wording of the question, which I revised Wednesday morning. Our goal is to get you to adjust for (among other variables) sex, ideally incorporated as an indicator variable for female, which you'll have to create from the available information.
    + We'll post grades for Homework 4 as soon as they are available.
