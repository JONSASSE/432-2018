# Announcements after the Class Meetings are Complete

## Course Evaluations!

You can easily complete your course evaluations by navigating to https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/ from your computer, smartphone or tablet. **PLEASE DO SO.** The evaluation window closes at 11:59 PM on Thursday May 10.

- As of 2018-05-02 at 10 PM, only 6 people out of the 41 in the class have completed a course evaluation. 

## Project Presentations

Please arrive for your presentation 10 minutes early, and if the door is open and the person ahead of you is finished, please come right in. My office is Wood WG-82L. Your project materials should be posted to Canvas at least three hours before your scheduled starting time. The [presentation schedule is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/PRESENTATIONS.md).

## Grading of Specific Tasks

### Homework 7

- The Homework 7 Grades (and comments from the TAs) are [posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/assignments/hw7/hw7grades.pdf) for your review.
    - If you want Dr. Love to regrade any of your Homework assignments from this semester, please fill out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/aQNPnlAWGIn72a7h1) to make that request before noon on Wednesday 2018-05-09.

### Quiz 2

- The grading of Quiz 2 is complete.
    - [Quiz 2 answer sketch is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/quizzes/quiz2/quiz02_and_answer_sketch.pdf), and it explains how each item on the Quiz was graded. 
        - The sketch uses an R package called [praise](https://github.com/rladies/praise) which provides "random" bits of praise when you (as a class) have done something good, or when you just need it. I apologize if this seems silly to you.
    - Here is a post containing the [grades on Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/quizzes/quiz2/quiz02grades.pdf). You should find your scores on Questions 35 and 36, plus your grade on the entire Quiz. 
    - If you have questions about your Quiz 2 grade, let Dr. Love know via email before May 9 at noon.

## Course Grade Information

The course score is determined as follows:

- **Course Participation** Up to 15 points for course participation, including feedback from the TAs and my reading of the class sessions and of the requests to me personally and to 431-help. Everyone scores at least 10/15.
- **Homework** Up to 25 points for the seven assignments, calculated by taking the sum of your seven homework assignments (each on a scale of 0-100) and adding to that the maximum score you had across the seven assignments (that assignment thus counts double) and dividing that sum by 32 to get a total score out of 25 points.
    - Should you decide to request a regrade of any Homework assignment by filling out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/aQNPnlAWGIn72a7h1), the result of that regrade is NOT yet included in this tally. I won't look at those requests until the afternoon on May 9.
- **Quizzes** Up to 25 points for the two quizzes, calculated by taking the sum of your score on Quiz 1 and your score on Quiz 2, and dividing that sum by 8.
- **Projects** Up to 35 points for the two projects, calculated by summing 40% of your Project 1 grade and 60% of your Project 2 grade, then multiplying that sum by 0.35. Project 2 grades will be determined on May 9 (and perhaps May 10, too) for all students, after all final revisions are in.

The resulting course score will be on a scale from 0-100. 
- Students with 90 and higher will definitely get an A in the course.
- Students with 70 and higher will get at least a B.
- I expect the final cutoff for an A grade to be somewhere between 85 and 89, but we'll see what happens when all the grades are in.
- Once all of the projects are graded, I will establish a cutoff score to separate A and B grades. I will then review the [Homework regrade requests](https://goo.gl/forms/aQNPnlAWGIn72a7h1). 
    - If a student already has an A grade, I will not regrade their Homework. 
    - If they are at risk of a B (or, gulp, even a lower grade) I will regrade the assignments they requested that I regrade. If their grade on the Homework is improved after a regrade, I will use it. If it's not improved, I will use the original grade from the TAs.
- When all of that is done, I will settle any final cases, and then post grades to the registrar as soon as possible. 
    - I expect to be finish this process sometime on Thursday May 10, in which case I would expect grades to be posted online on Monday of the next week.
