# 432 Class 21: 2018-04-03

## Key Materials

- The [slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class21) are posted.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class21) will appear when available.

Today's class will address building regression models for *ordered* multi-categorical outcomes, using proportional odds logistic regression. [Chapter 19 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/modeling-an-ordinal-categorical-outcome-in-ohio-smart.html) covers this topic.

## Special Announcements

1. As part of CWRU's National Public Health Week Speaker Series, I will deliver a presentation entitled **Adventures at Better Health Partnership: Learning as a Community (aided by Electronic Health Records) to make an impact on the Health of Northeast Ohio Adults** from Noon to 12:50 PM in room WRB-1223B this Thursday 2018-04-05. 
    - The session will be part of a week-long event (04-02 through 04-06) bringing together students across the Schools of Dental Medicine and of Medicine to learn about various aspects of public health. Details on all of the week's activities [can be found here](http://thedaily.case.edu/national-public-health-week/).
    - I will discuss things that I am not planning to discuss in 432, so the overlap should be minimal.

2. Our 432 class will meet in **E301**, rather than our usual E321-323 on Thursday of this week, 2018-04-05.

## Remaining Deliverables This Semester

The [Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) page is always the final word, if you are confused.

1. The Minute Paper after Class 22 will become available 2018-04-05 and is due at **10 AM Monday 2018-04-09**.

    - I'll warn you now that Homework 6 is not one of the "easy and quick" assignments this term. You need to build a visualization of professional quality, reflect on it, and fit several models to a data set I have provided.

## New Materials

1. [Chapters 17 and 18 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) are now fully part of the [main Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) material. I've fixed some problems in those Chapters, and a few small things in prior Chapters.

2. [Course Notes Chapter 19](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/modeling-an-ordinal-categorical-outcome-in-ohio-smart.html) is now a full part of the Course Notes, too. It's on proportional odds logistic regression models for ordinal multi-categorical outcomes, which is our topic today.

3. [Course Notes Chapter 20](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/analyzing-literary-styles-with-multinomial-logistic-regression.html) is now a full part of the Course Notes, too. It's on multinomial logistic regression models for nominal multi-categorical outcomes, and we'll discuss that topic on Thursday. 
    - Through Chapters 1-20, the Notes now weigh in at a way-too-long 532 pages. I'm really sorry about that. Logorrhea, asthma and obesity are my chronic illnesses.

4. Substantial new stuff was added as Section 6 of the [Project 2 Instructions](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/project2-instructions-432-2018.html). Please, **please** read this before you turn in your registration and scheduling form (due 2018-04-17.) 
    - I also very strongly encourage you to carefully read the [general Post-Project 1 Feedback](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project1/FEEDBACK.md). It's worth your time.

5. Your preparation for [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz2) will be aided by looking over the [Bonus Assignment after Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz1/bonus), even if you weren't eligible to actually do that assignment. An **answer sketch** for that Bonus Assignment [is now available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz1/bonus).
