# 432 Class 21: 2018-04-03

## Key Materials

- The [slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class21) are posted.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class21) will appear when available.

Today's class will address building regression models for *ordered* multi-categorical outcomes, using proportional odds logistic regression. [Chapter 19 of the Course Notes](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/texts/chapter19/README.md) covers this topic.

## Special Announcements

1. As part of CWRU's National Public Health Week Speaker Series, I will deliver a presentation entitled **Adventures at Better Health Partnership: Learning as a Community (aided by Electronic Health Records) to make an impact on the Health of Northeast Ohio Adults** from Noon to 12:50 PM in room WRB-1223B this Thursday 2018-04-05. 
    - The session will be part of a week-long event (04-02 through 04-06) bringing together students across the Schools of Dental Medicine and of Medicine to learn about various aspects of public health. 
    - I will discuss things that I am not planning to discuss in 432, so the overlap should be minimal.

2. Our 432 class will meet in **E301**, rather than our usual E321-323 on Thursday of this week, 2018-04-05.

## New Materials

1. [Chapters 17 and 18 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) are now fully part of the [main Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) material. I've fixed some problems in those Chapters, and a few small things in prior Chapters.

2. [Course Notes Chapter 19](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/texts/chapter19/README.md) is now posted, as a separate piece. It's on proportional odds logistic regression models for ordinal multi-categorical outcomes.

3. A substantial set of questions and answers were added as Section 6 of the [Project 2 Instructions](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/projects/project2/project2-instructions-432-2018.html). Please, **please** read them.

4. Your preparation for [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz2) will be aided by looking over the [Bonus Assignment after Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz1/bonus), even if you weren't eligible to actually do that assignment. An **answer sketch** for that Bonus Assignment [is now available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz1/bonus).
