# 432 Class 09: 2018-02-13

### Key Materials

- [The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class09) are posted above (including some of the material originally scheduled for Class 08.) I expect that we'll get through a bit more than half of these slides, and that the rest will be covered in Class 10.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class09) will be posted as soon as they are available.

In today's class, we'll continue our discussion of logistic regression.
