# 432 Class 09: 2018-02-13

### Key Materials

- [The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class09) are posted above (including some of the material originally scheduled for Class 08.) I expect that we'll get through a bit more than half of these slides, and that the rest will be covered in Class 10.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class09) will be posted as soon as they are available.

In today's class, we'll continue our discussion of logistic regression.

## Announcements Before Class 09

1. [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw4) is due at 1 PM on Friday 2018-02-16.
    - The ambiguity regarding controlling for smoking, for instance, is deliberate. You need to make a decision about what best to include in your model, and justify that decision. All I'll say is that there is more than one possible appealing approach.
    - The Homework 3 answer sketch and a draft of the grading rubric [are now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw3).
