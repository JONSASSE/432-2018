- *Left*: Rate the following subjects in terms of your current knowledge. 
    - "A Lot" = I know how to do this sort of analysis comfortably in R.
    - "Little" = I know a little about this, but not enough to comfortably do an analysis in R.
    - "DK" = I don't know much about this.
- *Right*: Rate the following subjects in terms of your interest in learning more about them.
    - "High" = Very interested in this topic.
    - "Some" = Somewhat interested in this topic.
    - "Not" = Not interested in this topic.
    - "DK" = I don't know enough about this to form an opinion.

### What question(s) about the course are uppermost in your mind now?

1. **When should I use `ols` as opposed to `lm`?**
    - This is a false choice. `ols` and `lm` fit identical models, but provide easy access to different types of output. If you want to use the output generated by the `rms` package using the `ols` function (like, for instance, a nomogram) it's easier to fit the model with `ols` to accomplish that. If you want to use output generated more easily by `lm` (like, for instance, the set of four residual plots) then use `lm`. Or use both. There's nothing to stop you from doing so.

2. **Why would we use nomograms?**
    - There are plenty of situations where you need a graphical representation of a model in order to understand how it works better.
    - There are plenty of situations where nomograms remain fast, compact and easy to use, especially when a computer isn't available.

3. **Is it always better to use complete case analyses for outcome variables, rather than imputing them?**
    - No, but it's often the simpler choice to explain to people. 
    - I'd argue that **multiple** imputation of outcomes is usually a competitive strategy with complete case analysis, since multiple imputation is primarily a way of taking the missingness into account in a rigorous way, but I don't think I'd say the same for simple imputation of outcomes.
    
4. **When is it better to use a spline vs. a polynomial fit?**
    - Another false choice. There's nothing stopping you from doing either in any setting.
    - A spline is likely a more obvious choice whenever you want to let the data decide where the bends in the curve are, rather than (essentially) pre-specifying them, so long as you don't care about explaining the guts of the model to other people. Describing what a spline does **inevitably** involves a graph.
    - If you do care deeply about explaining the guts of the model to other people (as opposed to explaining it to computers) then polynomial fits become more attractive than they do otherwise.

5. **How to select best possible regression model for the study?**
    - Get past the idea that there is one model that is best, and you just need to find it. All models are wrong, and many are useful. You just need to maximize your chances of finding something useful.

6. **It seems as though if degrees of freedom are a limiting factor, wouldn't that be really important, and drive our analysis?**
    - Exactly.
    
7. **What about comparing groups in randomized clinical trials?**
    - That was most of 431 Part B, and then our discussion of analysis of variance. If you're talking about a binary outcome, it's mostly 2x2 tables and chi-square tests so far, but there's a little more to come.

8. **What about adjusting for baseline differences?**
    - In a regression model, that was a large part of 431 Part C, and then our discussion of analysis of covariance.

9. **When do we use robust linear regression instead of ordinary least squares?**
    - Well, on some level, whenever you like.
    - But I guess the main point is that robust methods are more appealing when regression assumptions don't hold. 

10. **Does the survey you had us take imply `THIS-THING-I-WANT-YOU-TO-DO-WILL-HAPPEN-A-LOT-IN-THE-REST-OF-432`?**
    - No, it doesn't.
