```{r set-options, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment=NA)
options(width = 60)
```

## Setup

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(skimr)
library(simputation)
library(broom)
library(modelr)
library(tidyverse)

smartcle1 <- read.csv("data/smartcle1.csv")
```

## Today's Materials

- A linear regression model using factors and quantities as predictors
- Single imputation via the `simputation` package
- Models including product terms
- Interpreting interactions, making predictions

These ideas come from Chapters 2-5, mostly.

# Returning to the SMART BRFSS data (Notes Sections 2.8 - 2.11 and 5)

## We're going to build `smartcle3`

We'll use a piece of the `smartcle1` data, and **simply impute** missing values.

Variable | `NA`s | Description
---------: | --: | -----------------------------------------------------
`SEQNO` | 0 | respondent identification number (all begin with 2016)
`bmi` | 84 | Body mass index, in kg/m^2^
`sleephrs` | 8 | On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period?
`female` | 0 | Sex, 1 = female, 0 = male
`exerany` | 3 | Have you exercised at all in the past 30 days? (1 = yes, 0 = no)
`alcdays` | 46 | How many days during the past 30 days did you have at least one drink of any alcoholic beverage such as beer, wine, a malt beverage or liquor?

## `smartcle3` development

```{r create_smartcle3}
set.seed(20180123)

smartcle3 <- smartcle1 %>%
  select(SEQNO, bmi, sleephrs, female, alcdays, exerany) %>%
  impute_rhd(exerany ~ 1) %>%
  impute_pmm(sleephrs ~ 1) %>%
  impute_rlm(bmi ~ female + sleephrs) %>%
  impute_cart(alcdays ~ .) 

colSums(is.na(smartcle3))
```

## `skim(smartcle3)`

![](figs/fig01.png)

# Plot, early and often

## Using `female` to model `bmi`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(smartcle3, aes(x = factor(female), y = bmi)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Using `sleephrs` to model `bmi`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(smartcle3, aes(x = sleephrs, y = bmi)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Using `sleephrs` to model `bmi`, stratified by `female`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(smartcle3, aes(x = sleephrs, y = bmi, color = factor(female))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2)
```

## Using `female` and `sleephrs` and their interaction to model `bmi`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(smartcle3, aes(x = sleephrs, y = bmi, color = factor(female))) +
    geom_point() + 
    guides(col = FALSE) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ female, labeller = label_both) 
```

# Incorporating a categorical-quantitative product term in a regression model (See Sections 2.11 - 2.12 and 4)

## Building Two Models

We'll predict `bmi` using `female` and `sleephrs` 

- and their interaction
- without their interaction

```{r}
model_int <- lm(bmi ~ female * sleephrs, data = smartcle3)
model_noint <- lm(bmi ~ female + sleephrs, data = smartcle3)
```

## Comparing Nested Models via `glance`

```{r}
glance(model_int) %>% round(., 3)
glance(model_noint) %>% round(., 3)
```

## ANOVA comparison for nested models

```{r}
anova(model_int, model_noint)
```

## Predictions with `model_int`

```{r}
tidy(model_int)
```

## Interpreting the Interaction model

With interaction, we have... 

`bmi` = 27.95 + 2.47 `female` + 0.04 `sleephrs` - 0.45 `female` x `sleephrs`

- What is the predicted `bmi` for a male who sleeps 10 hours?
- What is the predicted `bmi` for a female who sleeps 10 hours?

## Interpreting the Interaction model

`bmi` = 27.95 + 2.47 `female` + 0.04 `sleephrs` - 0.45 `female` x `sleephrs`

- so for males, our model is: `bmi` = 27.95 + 0.04 `sleephrs`, and
- for females, our model is: `bmi` = 30.42 - 0.41 `sleephrs`

Both the slope and the intercept of the `bmi`-`sleephrs` model **depend** on `sex`

## Predictions with `model_noint`

```{r}
tidy(model_noint)
```

## Interpreting the NO Interaction model

Without interaction, we have... 

`bmi` = 29.79 - 0.67 `female` - 0.22 `sleephrs`

- Now, what is the predicted `bmi` for a male who sleeps 10 hours?
- What is the predicted `bmi` for a female who sleeps 10 hours?

## Interpreting the NO Interaction model

`bmi` = 29.79 - 0.67 `female` - 0.22 `sleephrs`

- so for males, our model is: `bmi` = 29.79 - 0.22 `sleephrs`,
- and for females, our model is: `bmi` = 29.12 - 0.22 `sleephrs`


Only the **intercept** of the `bmi`-`sleephrs` model depends on `sex`

- Change in `bmi` per additional hour of sleep **does not depend** on sex

## Next Time

- Centering and Rescaling Predictors
- Analysis of Variance
- Cross-validation of a linear model
- Sequential Variable Selection (Stepwise Regression)
  - Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, Allen-Cady approaches
- Best Subsets Variable Selection
  - Adjusted R^2^, bias-corrected AIC, BIC and C~p~
    
These ideas come from Chapters 2-8, mostly.
