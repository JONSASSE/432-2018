## Announcements Before Class 04

1. Don't forget to [submit Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw1) by 1 PM on Friday 2018-01-26. Use [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) to do so. If you have questions about the homework, please ask them at 431-help at case dot edu, or during [TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md#teaching-assistant-office-hours).

2. I will write something about the distinction between an additive and a multiplicative interaction.

3. I will write something about why we use 1/0 for indicator variables (like 1 = female, 0 = male) rather than 1/2 (1 = male, 2 = female) and what the impact of doing things the other way would be, practically.

Other suggestions or questions? - please email 431-help at case dot edu
