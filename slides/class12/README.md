# 432 Class 12: 2018-02-22

### Key Materials

- [The slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class12) above cover logistic regression on the Framingham data, and then linear regression with `ols` in the HERS trial. In the context of that `ols` fit, we'll be running multiple imputation.
- The [audio files](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/slides/class12) will be posted as soon as they are available.
