# Texts for 432, Spring 2018

The two key books we're reading this semester (see [the Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) for assigned dates) are:

- (**Leek**) Jeffrey Leek [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), which we'll read in its entirety. Buy an electronic copy at [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist). The book is about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way.
    - The book is 100 pages long. You can read it in a couple of hours. You need to finish the book by the end of February, but I've proposed a potential order for reading it in [the Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md). 
- (**R4DS**) Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which we'll read excerpts from. 
    - An electronic copy is available [at this link](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), or you can buy the book [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1515951123&sr=8-3&keywords=r+for+data+science) if you prefer a paperback copy.
    - I assume you already read **Sections 1-12 and 15** of this book in 431, so if you haven't, you'll want to do that before the end of February.
    - This term, we'll read Part IV (Model) and Part V (Communicate), before the first project is due in March.

There are lots of good resources in the world. Several excellent books on regression analysis are listed below, but I don't recommend you **read** anything, really. Instead, I recommend you develop a project with data you care about where such an analysis seems likely to be appropriate, and do the work, then look to see what happens when you make different decisions. That's the best way to start actually gaining useful experience.

- Frank Harrell's stuff is intimidating but great at http://www.fharrell.com/#links, and his Regression Modeling Strategies materials are especially relevant to our course.
- Julian Faraway's two books "Linear Models with R" and "Extending the Linear Model with R" are great, too, and provided a lot of source material for early versions of this course.
- Eric Vittinghoff and colleagues at UCSF have a great book called "Regression Methods in Biostatistics: Linear, Logistic, Survival, and Repeated Measures Models" but they use STATA rather than R.
- In a few years, I expect the best book on regression and many related matters is likely to be the new two-volume epic coming from Andrew Gelman and colleagues. But that doesn't yet have a release date. Gelman's book with Jennifer Hill entitled "Data Analysis using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models" is outstanding, and uses R, but I've never been able to figure out how to teach the multilevel material well in two semesters. 
- Daniel Wright and Kamala London's book "Modern Regression Techniques Using R" is subtitled a practical guide for students and researchers. Like all of these books, it's pre-tidyverse, but otherwise very helpful.
- Another useful resource is Simon J. Sheather's "A Modern Approach to Regression with R"
- 
- Another book anyone interested in data mining and machine learning should read is Hastie and Tibshriani's [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) I regret never making my way all the way through the book, but I've read some parts of it dozens of times. Very eye-opening.

Other required and recommended materials coming here as the semester progresses.
