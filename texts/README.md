# Texts for 432, Spring 2018

The two key books we're reading this semester (see [the Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) for assigned dates) are:

- (**Leek**) Jeffrey Leek [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), which we'll read in its entirety. Buy an electronic copy at [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist). The book is about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way.
    - The book is 100 pages long. You can read it in a couple of hours. You need to finish the book by the end of February, but I've proposed a potential order for reading it in [the Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md). 
- (**R4DS**) Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which we'll read excerpts from. 
    - An electronic copy is available [at this link](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), or you can buy the book [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1515951123&sr=8-3&keywords=r+for+data+science) if you prefer a paperback copy.
    - I assume you already read **Sections 1-12 and 15** of this book in 431, so if you haven't, you'll want to do that before the end of February.
    - This term, we'll read Part IV (Model) and Part V (Communicate), before the first project is due in March.

There are lots of good resources in the world. Several excellent books are listed below. 

- Frank Harrell's stuff is intimidating but great at http://www.fharrell.com/#links, and his Regression Modeling Strategies materials are especially relevant to 432.
    - [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](http://fharrell.com/doc/bbr.pdf) by Frank Harrell and James Slaughter. I've posted the [2018-01-29 version here].
    - [Course Notes for Regression Modeling Strategies](http://fharrell.com/doc/rms.pdf) by Frank Harrell. I've posted the [2018-01-29 version here].
    - [Frank's web page of links to his other materials](http://www.fharrell.com/#links)
    - The second edition of Frank's Regression Modeling Strategies is available as an e-book to CWRU affiliates.
- Julian Faraway's two books are great, and provided lots of source materials for early versions of this course.
    - "Linear Models with R" [Amazon link to 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Models-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1439887330/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1517953413&sr=1-2&refinements=p_27%3AJulian+J.+Faraway) and 
    - "Extending the Linear Model with R" [Amazon link to 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Extending-Linear-Model-Generalized-Nonparametric/dp/149872096X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1517953413&sr=1-1&refinements=p_27%3AJulian+J.+Faraway) 
    - A free book which includes some of this content and is available online is Faraway's 2002 [Practical Regression and ANOVA using R](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/texts/Faraway-PRA.pdf)
- Eric Vittinghoff, David Glidden, Stephen Shiboski and Charles McCulloch at UCSF have a great book called "Regression Methods in Biostatistics: Linear, Logistic, Survival, and Repeated Measures Models" but they use STATA rather than R.
    - The second edition of the Vittinghoff test is available as an e-book to CWRU affiliates.
- Simon J. Sheather's "A Modern Approach to Regression with R" has a lot of interesting material.
    - The Sheather text is available as an e-book to CWRU affiliates.
- Daniel Wright and Kamala London's book "Modern Regression Techniques Using R" [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Regression-Techniques-Using-2009-03-05/dp/B01FKWRTE2/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1517954445&sr=8-3&keywords=Wright+and+London+regression) is subtitled a practical guide for students and researchers. Like all of these books, it's pre-tidyverse, but otherwise very helpful.
- Andrew Gelman's book with Jennifer Hill entitled "Data Analysis using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models" is outstanding, and uses R, but I've never been able to figure out how to teach the multilevel material well in two semesters. 
- Another book anyone interested in data mining and machine learning should read is Hastie and Tibshriani's [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) I regret never making my way all the way through the book, but I've read some parts of it dozens of times. Very eye-opening.

Other required and recommended materials coming here as the semester progresses.
