# Quiz 2 Materials

Quiz 2 will be available to you at the end of class on Thursday 2018-04-26 and is due at noon on Tuesday 2018-05-01.

The link to take Quiz 2 is **to appear on 2018-04-26 after class.**

There are three data sets (.csv files) that you'll need, and they are:

- [data10.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/quizzes/quiz2/data10.csv)
- [data21.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/quizzes/quiz2/data21.csv) and
- [data37.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/master/quizzes/quiz2/data37.csv)

You will also need to look at the following HTML file:

Each of these files [can be downloaded here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz2).

Notes:

- The Quiz has 40 questions.
- Questions 1-36 are multiple choice questions, but Questions 37-40 require longer responses.
- It covers the entire 432 course through 2018-04-19.
- You must complete this Quiz by NOON on Tuesday May 1. You will have the opportunity to edit your responses after completing the Quiz, but this must be completed by the deadline. Be sure to save your work. To save your work, you will have to select your name below, and also answer the final question - the attestation that you did your work alone, and then submit it. The software will then provide you (and automatically email you) with a link to return to the Quiz while retaining your answers so far.
- Please select or type in your best response for each question.  Individual questions are worth between 2 and 5 points, towards a maximum score of 100. You should try to answer all 40 questions, as there is no difference in score between an incorrect answer and a blank answer. Partial credit will only be awarded on a few questions.
- You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are NOT allowed to discuss the questions on this Quiz with anyone other than the teaching assistants, and Professor Love. As a reminder, you can contact us at `431-help at case dot edu`. We will try to answer all questions in a timely way, but you should not leave things to the last moment.
- If you want to see a larger version of one of the Displays in this Quiz, I suggest you right click on the figure, and it should be possible to open  the figure in a new tab. I expect that will be sufficiently large.
